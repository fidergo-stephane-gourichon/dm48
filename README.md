# DM48

A dungeon exploration game with 3D first-person view for HP-48 handheld calculator of the 1900's.

Full game description and files to download to a HP48 are available on http://amphi-gouri.org/hp48/dm48 .

All this source code was written on a real HP-48 GX.

## Current state

* Following request on a [hacker news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20112479#unv_20133342) here is the source code.
* More precisely, this is an ASCII dump I did long ago from the directory on the HP-48.  HP-48 can send files binary (faster, round-trip-safe) or ASCII (slower, sometimes fails round-trip).

## Compilation requirements

If you want to compile the thing, your best bet is to start from the [source code as HP48 directory](http://amphi-gouri.org/hp48/dm48/index.html#telecharger) and send that to an HP-48 or emulator.

You need:

* A HP48-GX with 128k extra memory card or emulator, not merged.
* in the memory card, library 169
* in the memory card, library 1797
* (optional) in the memory card, library 1303 "StringWriter" by J.Y Avenard.
